        My name is Heriberto Lopez Jr., I'm born and raised in Houston, Texas.
        Throughout the years I've worked in the Oil & Gas Sector offerring machining services to several companies in and around Houston. 
        I have decided to manuver over to the tech industry and can't be more excited. Hopefully I am able to help wherever help is needed.
        I don't have Slack on my phones yet but please feel free to contact me by phone or by e-mail for a more timely response. It would be a pleasure meeting all of you
        and wish you the best in this next journey through coding that we're about to take.
